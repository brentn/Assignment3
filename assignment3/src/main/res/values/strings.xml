    she was approached by a [Adjective] [Animal] named [Girl\'s name] who asked her if she had ever been to [Place].  [+Girl\'s name] said that she [had|hadn\'t ever]
    been to [+Place] before, and asked the [+Animal] why it needed to know.  The [+Animal] said it was because it needed to [Verb] with a [Object], but had not been able to find
    a suitable [+Object] nearby.  A [Animal] wearing a [Color] [Article of clothing] had told her that if she [hurried|counted to 12|clicked her heels together 3 times], then
    she could find a [+Object] at [+Place].  But of course, the [+Animal] had never been to [+Place] before, and didn\'t know how to get there.  (Not to mention that

    the [+hero|warrior|alien] grabbed his [+Weapon] and gave it to [+Girl\'s name].  She took the [+Weapon] and with [practiced ease|bumbling luck] she threw the [+Weapon] down
    right in front of the [+Animal].  The [+Animal], confused by the situation, thought that the [+Weapon] might work as a [+Object], and picked it up and began to [+Verb]!
    The [+Animal] was [elated|dumbfounded|distracted], and while he was [+Verb]ing with the [+Weapon], [+Boy\'s name] the [+hero|warrior|alien] grabbed [+Girl\'s name]\'s hand
    and [kissed|slapped|twisted|shook] it, and they ran off together into the sunset.\n
    The [+Animal], confused, continued to [+Verb] with it\'s [+Object], and didn\'t even notice they had left.\n
